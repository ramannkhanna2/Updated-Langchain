       "\"Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). He is best known for his mass-energy equivalence formula E = mcÂ² and his work on the photoelectric effect, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. Einstein's theories have had a profound impact on our understanding of the universe and have influenced many aspects of modern science and technology.\""
